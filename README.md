Wind SCADA analysis

This is an analysis of SCADA data from the Kelmarsh project. The data comes from the Zenodo open database.

This dataset contains various files (see description at the following link) including 10-minute SCADA and status data from the 6 Senvion MM92's at Kelmarsh wind farm, grouped by year from 2016 to mid-2021.

Here are the results for one of the site's turbines in 2019.
